# FACTORS

# Factors are used to store categorical variables
# The factor() is used to create and modify factors in R
factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female"))

# There's two types of categorical variables:

# Nominal categorical variables have no natural ordering:
factor(c("Blue", "Yellow", "Green"))

# Ordinal categorical variable have a natural ordering
factor(c("Medium", "High", "Low"), ordered=TRUE, levels("Low", "Medium", "High)

# When using the factor function, it will assign levels to your data set
# The levels are applied as numeric values, but if you want to change the name of the levels you can use:
levels(level1, level2... )

# Using summaris() will give you an overview of your variable. Applying factors to your variable will change the summary:
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")                  # Build factor_survey_vector with clean levels
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
factor_survey_vector

summary(survey_vector)                                       # Generate summary for survey_vector
summary(factor_survey_vector)                                # Generate summary for factor_survey_vector

# If using ordinal categorical variables, comparison is possible
# Create factor_speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("slow", "medium", "fast"))

da2 <-factor_speed_vector[2]                                 # Factor value for second data analyst
da5 <- factor_speed_vector[5]                                # Factor value for fifth data analyst
da2>da5                                                      # Is data analyst 2 faster than data analyst 5?
