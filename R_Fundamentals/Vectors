# Vectors
# A collection of values that all have the same data type. Can be created in a number of ways:
 
Vector <- c(21, 38, 2)                # c is the combine/concatenate function
Vector(class of object, length = n)   # Creating an empty vector
Vector <- seq(1, 10, by = 1)          # Using the sequence function
numeric(5)                            # a numeric vector with five elements

# Naming elements within a vector
names(vector) <-c(name1, name2... )   # Both sides must have equal length
# A quicker way
NameVector <- c(name1, name2... )
names(vector) <- NameVector

# Vector Arithmetic
# The vectors must be of equal lengths. When adding two vectors together it will add together each corresponding element.
A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
B_vector <- c(4, 5, 6)
A_vector + B_vector

# Same applies for the other arithmetic operators

# You can use multipliers and scalars on vectors
A_vector * 2
A_vector + 0.2

# To select a specific element within a vector:
A_vector[2]
# Multiple selection
A_vector[c(2,3)]  #OR
A_vector[2:3]
