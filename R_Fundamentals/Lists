# LISTS

# Similar to how a dataframe is matrix with different data types, a list is a vector that can store more than one data type
# A list is still considered 1 dimensional BUT it can store lists of 2 dimensional data structures

my_vector <- 1:10                                               # Vector with numerics from 1 up to 10
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)                              # Matrix with numerics from 1 up to 9
my_df <- mtcars[1:10,]                                          # First 10 elements of the built-in data frame mtcars
my_list <- list(my_vector, my_matrix, my_df)                    # Construct list with these different elements:
my_list

# You can assign names to each list component
names(my_list) <- c("vec", "mat", "df")
my_list
# Alternatively you can do it all in one go
my_list <- list(vec = my_vector, mat = my_matrix, df = my_df)   

# Selecting things in lists
my_list$vec
my_list$vec[3]
